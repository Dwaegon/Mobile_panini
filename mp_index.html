       <strong>Mobile Panini</strong>
       is theculmination of the dream of Antonio and Carmen Dolcini, who came to 
       America looking to se rve people the authentic recipes learned from their 
       Sicilian family.  
     </p>

     <p>
       Antonio began work as a child in his grandmother's deli where he
       learned the age-old secrets of Sicilian cooking.He refined his
       technique at the Culinary Institute of Milan.His younger brother,
       Carmen,with no less of a love for cooking and good food, also
       worked in the deli and became well-acquainted with the open-air
       fresh food markets of his home town.Carmen too,is a proud graduate<br />
       of the Culinary Institute of Milan.
     </p>

     <p>
       Now you can enjoy what they have learned and mastered, right outside 
       your door; but with no compromises in freshness or delicacy of preparation.
       We've partnered with <emp>Curbside Thai</emp> to bring you the finest cuisine 
       on four wheels - from the East and the West!
